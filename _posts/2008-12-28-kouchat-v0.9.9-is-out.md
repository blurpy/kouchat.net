title: KouChat v0.9.9 is out!
---

I released KouChat version 0.9.9 yesterday, 11 months after 0.9.8. 

What happened? My plan was to release 1.0 shortly after 0.9.8, because my todo list was getting very short. I didn't really have any big plans for the next release. So I took a break! Then I started to use Vista at work, and noticed that Vista handled networking in a very strange way which KouChat didn't expect. 

And then I got suggestions of improvements and feature requests. And I wanted to do a lot of documentation, and testing. And take more breaks! Hey, where did those months go!? 

Well, here's what you can expect in this release: 

* Hopefully better handling of the network connection 
* Smileys :) 
* A choice of which look and feel to use 
* Tweaks to the user interface, especially with the GTK+ and Nimbus look and feels 
* Improvements to notifications when a new message arrives 
* Lots of new code documentation 
* Open folder button on the file transfer dialog 
* Support for running KouChat on more advanced local networks with routers 
* Misc tweaks and fixes all over 

You might also have noticed that I brushed up the web site with more screenshots and more information. 

Have fun :)
