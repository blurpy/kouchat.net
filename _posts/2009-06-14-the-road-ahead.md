title: The road ahead
---

Like so many other open source developers, I started KouChat because I had an itch to scratch. With 1.0 out the door, a big part of that itch has been scratched.

But I'm not all done yet! I've added a [roadmap](https://code.google.com/p/kouchat/wiki/Roadmap) to the wiki with my current thoughts for the road ahead. This roadmap is mostly made up of suggestions from other KouChat users. Which is great! Comments and suggestions are welcome :)
