title: GitHub removed all downloads
---

GitHub has decided that they don't want to host downloads anymore. I used to have the Android apk-files there, for those unable to install KouChat from Google Play. The files have been moved to the downloads section of this site instead.

I wish they had notified me about the change, instead of just removing the functionality and making me "google" the reason. Anyway, the announcement from GitHub can be read here: [https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads)
