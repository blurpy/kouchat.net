title: KouChat for Android v0.13.0 is out!
---

The first release of the year is here :)

The focus this time has been minor tweaks to the user interface, and bug fixes. The tweaks mostly consists of extra padding, and increased font sizes (on tablets).

I hoped these changes would get KouChat accepted as a "tablet app" on Google Play, but I failed. The store still displays a warning that this is a "phone app" when visiting from a tablet. D'oh! Tips are welcome!

_04.02.2014 - After I requested a manual review, Google approved KouChat as a tablet app :)_

Google also [deprecated](http://google-opensource.blogspot.no/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html) the downloads here on Google Code, so I'm unable to add any more downloads. As a workaround I have added the latest releases of KouChat and KouChat Android to a Google Drive account. Links to both are available in the new downloads section.

The changelog:

* Increased the height of list items in the user list to 48dp, as recommended by Google.
* Increased the width of the user list on tablets.
* Added padding around the chat area.
* Increased the font size on tablets.
* Fixed issue that caused lines in the chat area with smileys to have extra padding.
* Fixed several crash issues when rotating.
* Messages are trimmed before added to the chat, to avoid blank lines.
* Fixed bug where it was possible to remove KouChat notifications by swiping on some devices. 

Get it on Google Play, or download the apk from the downloads section.
