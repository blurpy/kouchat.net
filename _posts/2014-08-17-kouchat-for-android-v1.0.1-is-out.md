title: KouChat for Android v1.0.1 is out!
---

This is a bug fix release.

There have been some crashes reported when the network connection is down, so this release should fix that.

Thanks to those who report crashes, it's very appreciated! I'd like to ask again for more details in the crash report though. The best is a list of steps to reproduce the problem. If you don't know how to reproduce, then it helps with some description of the last thing you did when it happened.

The changelog:

* Fixed crash when hiding and showing KouChat without a network connection.
* Added details about missing connections in the ActionBar. 

Get it on Google Play, or download the apk from the downloads section.
