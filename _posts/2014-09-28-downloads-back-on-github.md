title: Downloads are back on GitHub
---

GitHub has added downloads again, called [releases](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software) this time. It's been available a little while, but I was not aware of it when Google stopped allowing downloads on Google Code, so I added the downloads to Google Drive. I've never been happy with the usability of Google Drive, so now I've moved all downloads, including the archive, to GitHub. 

Links are in the downloads section.
